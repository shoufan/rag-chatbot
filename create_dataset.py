Provide all necessary information, evidence, and documents to your appointed representative and us. 3. Get our agreement before instructing a barrister or expert witness. 4. Assess the potential value of the claim and the cost of legal action with your appointed representative. 5. If there are conflicting opinions, obtain an expert opinion from a barrister agreed upon by us. 6. Evaluate the offer to settle the claim, and if approved, settle the claim outside of court. 7.
