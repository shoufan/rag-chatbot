User: What is the process to make a claim?
Bot:  The process to make a claim is as follows:

1. Notify your appointed representative of any developments related to the claim.
2. Provide your appointed representative and us with any information, evidence, and documents you have or know about as soon as possible.
3. Get our agreement before instructing a barrister or expert witness.
4. Your appointed representative will assess the potential value to be gained in pursuing your case and the cost of taking legal action.
5. If there are conflicting opinions, we may ask you to get an expert opinion from a barrister that we agree on.
6. You must tell us if anyone offers to settle your claim or makes a payment into court.
7. We may settle your claim outside of court if we think it makes financial sense to do so.
8. We have the right to have costs certified, checked by an auditor, or assessed by a court.
